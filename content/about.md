Hi, I am Ashok Viswanadha. Born in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India.

I moved to US in 2012 after my Undergrad from [IIIT](https://www.iiit.ac.in) and currently
working at Google, California.

Turned 30 in 2021, decided to start writing some of my experiences and readings.
I am an avid reader of Telugu literature and Outdoor enthusiast, which are
main categories of this blog.
